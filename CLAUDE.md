# Claude Code Operating Rules for JuriBank Educational Platform v3.0

## Core Working Principles

### 1. Plan-First Approach
- First think through the problem thoroughly
- Read the codebase for relevant files and context
- Write a comprehensive plan to `tasks/todo.md`
- The plan should have a list of todo items that can be checked off as completed

### 2. Collaboration & Verification  
- Before beginning work, check in with the user to verify the plan
- Get approval before executing major changes
- Maintain clear communication throughout the process

### 3. Incremental Progress
- Begin working on todo items systematically
- Mark tasks as complete as you progress through them
- Give high-level summaries of changes made at each step
- Track progress transparently using the TodoWrite tool

### 4. Code Quality Standards
- Make every code/task change as simple as humanly possible
- Avoid broad refactors unless absolutely necessary
- Minimize the code impact of every change
- Simplicity always wins over complexity

### 5. Excellence Standards
- **DO NOT BE LAZY. NO HALF FIXES.**
- Find the root cause and fix it properly
- Complete every task thoroughly
- Never leave work in a broken or incomplete state

### 6. Documentation & Review
- Add a review section to `todo.md` summarizing completed work
- Keep all documentation updated and accurate
- Maintain clear project structure and organization

## Available Slash Commands

### `/init`
Initialize the complete JuriBank development environment:
- Environment setup verification (Node.js, dependencies, Git, Vercel)
- Agent system verification (all 11 specialized agents)
- Core systems check (regulatory monitoring, citation engine, compliance calendar)
- Brand verification (JuriBank assets, colors, typography)
- Development tools validation (build process, linting, testing)

### `/update-docs`
Automatically updates all documentation across the project:
- Scans latest codebase changes and system status
- Updates all README.md files with current project information
- Refreshes CLAUDE.md with latest rules and agent configurations
- Synchronizes documentation in `/docs/` directory
- Updates project metadata and package information
- Keeps documentation in sync with code changes

### `/project-health`
Provides comprehensive project status overview:
- Count of remaining tasks in `todo.md`
- Number of commits made recently
- Files changed today
- Unresolved bugs listed in `errors/debug.log`
- Claude's assessment of current repository state
- Agent system health and availability
- Core intelligence systems operational status
- Overall project health summary

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Educational Platform Requirements
- **Information accuracy is essential** - Users depend on current, reliable information
- All educational content must be reviewed for accuracy and clarity
- UK regulatory information focus (PRA, FCA, Bank of England, Gov.UK)
- Use accessible language while maintaining precision
- Source all information from official APIs and authoritative sources
- Maintain educational boundaries - guide understanding, don't provide legal advice

```

### Development Workflow
1. **Research Phase** - Understand requirements and existing code
2. **Planning Phase** - Create detailed todo list in `tasks/todo.md`
3. **Approval Phase** - Get user verification before proceeding
4. **Implementation Phase** - Execute tasks incrementally
5. **Review Phase** - Document changes and update todos
6. **Testing Phase** - Verify all functionality works correctly

### Git & Version Control
- Commit changes only when code executes without errors
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Include Claude Code attribution in commits
- Never commit broken or incomplete code
- Auto-commit hook validates code before committing

## Agent Integration

The project utilizes specialized AI agents for different aspects of money and finance help education and development:

### Legal Information & Educational Agents
- **Regulatory Information Agent** - UK banking regulations educational content

- **FinTech Education Agent** - Digital payments, emerging tech guidance
- **AML Education Agent** - Anti-money laundering information and awareness
- **Risk Education Agent** - Understanding operational, credit, regulatory risks
- **Legal Information Validator** - Educational content accuracy and compliance boundaries

### Development & Quality Agents
- **Legal Documentation Agent** - Professional legal documentation and writing standards
- **Code Quality Auditor** - Comprehensive code review and security assessment
- **Test Architect** - Banking-grade testing strategies and implementation
- **Configuration Manager** - Development environment and build optimization
- **UI/UX Designer** - Professional banking application interface design
